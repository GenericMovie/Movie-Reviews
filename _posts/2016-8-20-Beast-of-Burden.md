Premise: Sean Haggerty only has an hour to deliver his illegal cargo. An hour to reassure a drug cartel, a hitman, and the DEA that nothing is wrong. An hour to make sure his wife survives. And he must do it all from the cockpit of his Cessna.

Review-

Jesper Ganslandt's Beasts of Burden gave a Locke-type feel but fell short at a lot of places. A typical example of a bottle movie. It places some burdens on the audience, none of which is worth enduring. Although it has several actors playing different irrelevant characters, all you see throughout the movie is a guy sitting in the cockpit of his Cessna going through an emotional break-down. The editing seems a little disjointed at several places which cause confusion related to the protagonist. The writing was all over the place with twist and flashbacks coming in a not so proper, repetitive and over-explanatory way, which I believe could have been done in a better way. Nothing much happens throughout the course of the movie, beginning with regretting his past decisions to worrying for his ailing wife till the end he finally comes out of that claustrophobic plane. Grace Summer who plays the character of Haggerty’s wife did an abysmal job portraying it. The climax felt a little stretched out and predictable. All in all the movie was very insipid and bland.

Reasons to Watch – Daniel Radcliffe, the drowning at the end

Reason to not watch – Everything else basically
